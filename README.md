Methods of Advanced Data Engineering: An Analysis of Distribution of Students at Higher Studies Across Universities in Nepal

This project aims to see the overall distribution of student in higher studies in Nepal in the year 2018 based on different universities, gender of students, location and types of campuses.

# Data Sets

All the datasets have been taken from Open Data Nepal

Implementation

Data from above sources are handled by the data loader pipeline. Necessary data transformation methods are implemented to make the data uniform and homogenous. To effectively catch the errors in  the code flow, test cases have been written to check them.

Final Results

This project explored the data sets to find the distribution of students across various universities in Nepal. Further details and can be found in project-plan.md as well. The final report containing the findings is available as a notebook in file [project/report.ipynb]. The codes which generated those findings are available as a notebook too.
